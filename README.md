This are binary builds  (ready to use compiled programs)
of 
the cjdns project,
the cjdns-ext fork,
and possibly other related data.

LICENCE:
========

All this is provided "AS IS" and we give you no warranty of any kind.

SECURITY:
=========

Please check which branch are you using, what directory
and what file name - because some files are experimental
and untested.

**TODO**
On windows, currently, not all files are built from sources by us,
(e.g. NSIS plugins, the OpenVPN TUN driver).

If security is more important to you then we recommend, as always,
to build yourself from sources (best - after checking the sources).
